Dictionaries Exercises


Create a dictionary named person with keys "name", "age", and "city" and assign them values (e.g., "Alice", 30, and "New York"). Then, print the dictionary.

Given the dictionary person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}, print the value associated with the key "age".

Start with the dictionary fruit_colors = {"apple": "red", "banana": "yellow"}. Add a new key "grape" with the value "purple" and then print the updated dictionary.

Using the dictionary person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}, update the value of "age" to 31 and print the modified dictionary.

Given the dictionary person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}, remove the key "city" using the pop() method and print the updated dictionary.

With the dictionary person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}, write a loop that iterates over the dictionary and prints each key along with its corresponding value.
