# 1. Create two variables, x and y, each containing an integer value. Create a third variable z that is equal to the sum of x and y.
'''
x = 4
y = 5
z = x + y
print(z)
'''
# 2. Create a variable x containing an integer value. Transform that value into a float and save it under the same variable x
'''
x = 4
print(x)
x = float(x)
print(x)
'''
# 3. Define two variables, a and b, with integer values. Multiply them together and store the result in a new variable c.
'''
a = 9
b = 8
c = a * b
print(c)
'''
# 4. Assign two integers to variables num1 and num2. Write an expression that
# calculates the remainder when num1 is divided by num2 and store the result in a variable called remainder.
'''
num1 = 47
num2 = 2
remainder = num1 % num2
print(remainder)
'''
# 5. Create variables base and exponent with integer values. Calculate base raised to
# the power of exponent and assign it to a variable named result.
'''
base = 4
exponent = 3
result = base ** exponent
print(result)
