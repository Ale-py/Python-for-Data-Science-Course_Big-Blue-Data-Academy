# 1. Create a variable greeting that stores the string "Hello, world!" and print it.
greeting = "Hello, world!"
print(greeting)
# 2. Define two variables, first_name and last_name, each containing a string. Concatenate
# them with a space in between to form a new variable full_name, and then print it.
first_name = "Siera"
last_name = "Pier"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)
# 3. Assign the string "Python" to a variable. Use indexing to print the first character and the last character of the string.
newString = "Python"
print(newString[0] + newString[-1])
# 4. Using the string "Python", extract a substring (for example, "ytho") using slicing, and print the result.
slicing = "Python"
print(slicing[1:5])
# 5. Create a variable word with a string of your choice. Use the len() function to print the length of the string.
word = "What's up?"
print(len(word))
# 6. Assign a string to a variable. Convert the string to uppercase using the upper() method and
# to lowercase using the lower() method, then print both results.
word = "HeLlo WoRld!"
print(word + " " + word.lower()+ " " + word.upper())
# 7. Create a variable containing a sentence. Use the find() method to locate
# a specific word within the sentence and print the index where it first appears.
sentence = "My name is Nemo and i like games and i like food."
print(sentence.find("and"))
print(sentence.find("and",17))
